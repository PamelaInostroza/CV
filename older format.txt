\section{About me}
I have mainly worked in research on social issues, as well as economic and financial aspects, especially for government and international agencies. I have experience developing statistical analysis in different areas, using administrative data, large scale assessments and other types of surveys, applying data analysis techniques accordingly to the research question. I also have experience coding programs in different statistical packages to ma-nage data and compute indicators using mathematical and statistical procedures as well as for creating automatized reports.\\ 
I have the ability to work in culturally sensitive contexts and achieve results under cha-llenging circumstances (problem-solving). I have excellent communication abilities (active listener). I have experience training groups in statistical and software matters, a good sense of dialogue and skills to create consensus, also I am responsible, committed and flexible. I understand the meaning of working in a multi-disciplinary team.\\
Currently, I am renewing my expertise in the field, joining the Master in Statistics at KU Leuven in Belgium. For this reason I am looking for a freelance, home based job related to Statistical programming.\\

\section{Freelance consultancy}

DATIC born as a necessity to help institutions with their data manipulation and analysis. We've had the opportunity to work and learn new techniques for research, data processing and report. We've experienced working remotely with national and international institutions.\\

\textbf{Synthesis consultants, Santiago, Chile, 2019}\\
We participate in the "Economic Development of San Antonio" project, for the Municipality of San Antonio in Chile awarded by public tender to Synthesis consultants.
Our main responsibilities were the creation and validation of a survey applied to formal and entrepreneurial companies of the commune. Automation of the procedures for processing the instruments, validation of scales and creation of indicators. Modelling the main influencing factors in the economic development of the productive units of the commune.\\

\textbf{International Labour Organization (ILO), Santiago, Chile, 2019}\\
In 2019, for the framework of Child's Risk Identification Model's design, to be used by the Ministry of Labour. We participate jointly with a team of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) in the implementation of a child labour vulnerability index. The main tasks was a literature review, compilation, and validation of the variables associated with child labour; application of statistical techniques for the indicator creation. Development of regional vulnerability maps at the communal level of Chile.\\

\textbf{Chilean Ministry of Environment, Santiago, Chile, 2018}\\
During the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, I worked as an external consultant for the project ‚ÄúDetermination of indirect product packaging in imports and exports, contained in Law 20.920‚Äù. We were in charge of identifying and establish criteria to determine the pro-ducts to be considered in the calculation of indirect imports and exports of residual waste. The analysis was done accordingly to the National Tariff Code and information regarding imports and exports in Chile during 2016. We use big data solutions in software R.\\

\textbf{IEA Data Processing Center, Hamburg, Germany, 2017-2018}\\
As consultants for ‚ÄúImproving the Availability of Education Data in the Caribbean‚Äù project, where we participate jointly with IEA team, in the creation and validation of a context questionnaire to be applied together with examinations, implemented in the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC). We participate in the report of results and recommendations for the definitive application of the context questionnaire.\\

\textbf{Chilean Ministry of Education, Santiago, Chile, 2010/2016/2017}\\
We have worked with this institution in three different opportunities.

In 2017, we participate in the project "Automatize and updating the information of statal universities files" supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), We performed the automation of administrative reports of each Statal University. The implementation was done in R software, code generation that allows the replicability of reports, and updating tables and graphs.\\

In 2016 we replicated the official calculation for the selection of winners school in the National Performance Evaluation System (SNED), using software R. With this information, simulation of different methodologies was done.\\

In 2010, we develop the recalculation and verification of Chile's results in PISA 2009 international report. We implement statistical models for students results. WE generate comparative graphical and tabular information for both, Chile and comparable participating countries, using SAS macros programmes for complex sample studies.\\

\textbf{Colombian Institute for the Evaluation of Education (ICFES), Bogota, Colombia, 2016-2017}\\
In 2016-2017 period, as part of the Educational Policy and Practice Studies centre (CEPPE) team, we participate in the statistical processing of "Technical Assistance for the processing of Associated Factors for the Colombian Institute for the Evaluation of Education (ICFES)‚Äù project. This consisted in modelling factors associated with learning for the several years 2012-2015. We produce the automation of procedures and reports in software R.\\

\textbf{Nicaraguan Ministry of Education, Managua, Nicaragua, 2016}\\
During 2016, as part of the consulting team in the project "Accompaniment to the Nicaraguan Ministry of Education in the implementation and analysis of the results for their national educational evaluation". As part of the Educational Policy and Practice Studies centre (CEPPE) team, we conducted training to members of the ministry evaluation department, the main subjects studied were educational research methodologies and practical exercises using SPSS and HLM software.\\

\textbf{United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Santiago, Chile, 2016}\\
In 2016, we carried out the construction of a typology of countries according to their degree of progress in terms of secondary education. We collect online information for educative indicators for 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Data analysis and construction of country typology was done in SPSS software.\\

\textbf{Education Quality Agency of Chile, Santiago, Chile, 2015}\\
Consultancy to determine the "Internal coherence of the Other Quality Indicators (ICO) 2015". Our tasks were review methodologies used in the official calculation of Personal and Social Development indicators. We implement automatical routines for the calculation of these indicators in SAS software, using macros, data steps and statistical procedures as, exploratory factor analysis, cluster analysis to determine group levels among others. The automation took into account the aggregation of different levels of data, and subjects. We had to check with the client procedures equivalence and differences until the results were the same at decimals accuracy.\\

\textbf{National Statistics Institute of Chile, Santiago, Chile, 2012/2014}\\
In the years 2012 and 2014, we perform consulting on SAS programming of routines for the calculation of Economic Indicators (IRCI, CPI). We perform an external audit of the methodology applied concerning data validation, imputation of missing data, aggregation of indicators and seasonal treatment of products.


\section{Others}

\textbf{Experience giving workshops}\\
We've participated in workshops as a speaker in statistical techniques and software applications.\\

\emph{SAS enterprise guide (INE), Statistical techniques in R (INE), Multilevel Modelling with Mplus (UNESCO), Analysis of associated factors with SPSS (MINED - Nicaragua), Use of complex databases with SAS (Education Quality Agency), Psychometric analysis of context questionnaire with R (INEVAL - Ecuador)}.
